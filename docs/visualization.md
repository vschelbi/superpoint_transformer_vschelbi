# Visualization

We provide a tool for interactive 3D visualization of `Data` and `NAG` objects. 
This allows you to inspect what your `Data` attributes look like, check whether your model's 
predictions make sense, and even share your interactive visualizations as 
simple, portable, HTML files. 

> **Note**: If you are not familiar with our `Data` and `NAG` structures yet, 
> check the [Data](docs/data_structures.md) documentation.

## Let the `show()` begin
Our `show()` function rules all visualizations. It can be used as follows:

```python
from src.visualization import show

# Visualize a Data object
show(data)
```

It is also possible to directly call `show()` as a `Data` or `NAG` method:

```python
# Visualize a Data object
data.show()

# Visualize a NAG object
nag.show()
```

Datasets inheriting from our `BaseDataset` class also have a `show_examples()` 
method that returns some spherical samples for a given class, randomly picked 
across the dataset.

```python
# Visualize `max_examples` random spherical samples of size `radius`, 
# centered on points annotated as `label`
dataset.show_examples(label, radius=4, max_examples=5)
```

## Visualizing data attributes
Given a `Data` or a `NAG` object, `show()` will automatically look for and plot 
some specific point attributes. It generates an interactive 
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python) graph with intuitive navigation controls and
buttons for accessing different **visualization modes üîò**.

The `pos` attribute is used to plot point positions. The üîò`Position RGB` mode 
will display points colored with respect to their location in the scene.

</p>

If the points carry colors in the `rgb` attribute, the üîò`RGB` mode will display 
them.

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="../media/viz_rgb.png">
</p>

If the points carry semantic segmentation labels in the `y` attribute, the 
üîò`Labels` mode  will display them. In addition, `show(class_colors=..., class_names=...)` 
can be passed to adjust the color palette and the name displayed 
when mouse hovering the graph. Similarly, if the points carry panoptic 
segmentation labels in the `obj` attribute, the üîò`Panoptic` mode will show them.
Passing `show(stuff_classes=..., num_classes=...)` allows for adjusting how
_thing_, _stuff_, and _void_ classes are displayed.

  <img width="80%" src="../media/viz_y.png">
</p>

If the points carry some features in the `x` attribute, the üîò`Features 3D` mode
will display them. 

> **Note**: This only supports point-wise features stored as 1D or 2D 
> tensors. If the tensor contains only 1 channel, the attribute will be 
> represented with a grayscale colormap. If the tensor contains 2 or 3 channels,
> these will be represented as RGB, with an additional all-1 channel if need be.
> If the tensor contains more than 3 channels, a PCA projection to RGB will be 
> shown. In any case, the attribute values will be rescaled with respect to their
> statistics before visualization, meaning that colors may not compare between two
> different plots.

If the points carry superpoint partition indices in the `super_index` attribute,
the üîò`Level i` mode will display partition level `i`. Several options can be 
passed to `show()` to adjust how partitions are shown: with centroids, with 
horizontal graph edges, with vertical graph edges, with feature-colored edges, 
etc. See the
[exhaustive list of parameters of `show()`](#exhaustive-parameter-list-for-show)
for more details.

</p>

If the points carry semantic segmentation predictions in the `semantic_pred` 
attribute, the üîò`Semantic Pred.` mode  will display them. Besides, if both 
`semantic_pred` and `y` can be found in the input, the üîò`Error` button can be
used to highlight the erroneous predictions, as shown in red here below. 
Similarly, `panoptic_pred` attributes can be visualized in the 
üîò`Panoptic Pred.` mode.

> **Tip üí°**: **Want to visualize other point attributes stored in your `Data` 
> object ?** Pass them to `show(keys=...)` to have them displayed ! The same
> coloring mechanisms as mentioned above for the `x` attribute will be used.

## Points selection for visualization
Our [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python)-based visualization is mostly meant for
quick interactive experiments with up to ~10‚Åµ points. While it is possible to 
visualize more points at once, Plotly will take a while to generate the plot. We 
provide several tools for reducing the number of point displayed, hence 
accelerating the visualization speed.

Say you have the following large-scale visualization.

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="../media/viz_100k.png">
</p>

You can choose to alleviate the visualization time by sampling some points.
This can be done in one of two ways:

- random sampling with respect to a maximum point budget with:
```python
show(max_points=...)
```

- grid sampling (ie voxelization) with:
```python
show(voxel=...)
```

This can make your visualization run faster, at the expense of resolution.

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="../media/viz_10k.png">
</p>

Another strategy is to simply visualize a smaller area. To this end, one can 
visualize only a spherical crop of the scene with:
```python
show(radius=..., center=...)
```

<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="../media/viz_radius_center.png">
</p>

We also provide a tool for displaying point selections with: 
```python
show(select=..., alpha=...)
```

This internally calls `NAG.select()` and `Data.select()` and applies an
`alpha` opacity to the non-selected points. This is typically useful for 
visualizing binary masks across the scene. Here is, for example, the mask
corresponding to the previous spherical cropping operation.

## Sharing your visualization as an HTML
You can export your Plotly figure as an HTML file which can be conveniently
opened by virtually anyone with a browser. To this end, simply specify a `path` 
to which your HTML should be saved, along with a figure `title`, if need be: 
```python
show(path=..., title=...)
```

Yet, if `input` contains other attributes that you want to visualize, these can be passed as `keys`. This only supports point-wise attributes stored as 1D or 2D tensors. If the tensor contains only 1 channel, the attribute will be represented with a grayscale colormap. If the tensor |contains 2 or 3 channels, these will be represented as RGB, with an additional all-1 channel if need be.

## üöÄ¬†¬†Getting started with visualization
See the [`notebooks/demo_nag.ipynb`](../notebooks/demo_nag.ipynb) notebook to play with our visualization tool 
on a provided `NAG`, without needing a whole dataset.

For more information, have a look at the code in `src.visualization`, it is
fairly commented and should help you gain a deeper understanding of the 
visualization mechanisms.
