## ðŸ“ŒÂ Â Description

HiST is a superpoint-based transformer architecture that efficiently performs 
semantic segmentation on large-scale 3D scenes. This method includes a fast 
algorithm that partitions point clouds into a hierarchical superpoint structure, 
as well as a self-attention mechanism to exploit the relationships between 
superpoints at multiple scales. 

## ðŸ§±Â Â Installation

```bash
# Creates an conda named 'spt' env and installs dependencies
./install.sh
```

Setup your `data/` and `logs/` directories. By default, these folders will 
be placed in the project directory. But since these may quickly take some space,
you may specify your default paths for these directories by creating the
`configs/local/defaults.yaml` file with the following format:

```yaml
# @package paths

# path to data directory
data_dir: /path/to/your/data/

# path to logging directory
log_dir: /path/to/your/logs/
```

<details>
<summary><b>Logs will be saved under the following directory structure.</b></summary>

## ðŸš€Â Â Reproducing our results

<details>
<summary><b>What will next commands do for you ?</b></summary>

- Download the dataset to your `data/` 
- Place the raw dataset files in `data/<dataset_name>/raw/`
- Preprocess the dataset and save the output to `data/<dataset_name>/processed/`
- Training a model and log the results

</details>


```bash
# Train HiST on S3DIS Fold 5
python src/train.py trainer=gpu model=hist_s3dis datamodule=s3dis datamodule.fold=5 trainer.max_epochs=2000

# Train HiST on KITTI-360 Val
python src/train.py trainer=gpu model=hist_kitti360 datamodule=kitti360 trainer.max_epochs=200 

# Train HiST on DALES
python src/train.py trainer=gpu model=hist_dales datamodule=dales trainer.max_epochs=400
```

You may use [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai) to track your experiments, 
by adding the adequate argument:

```bash
# Log S3DIS experiments to W&B
python src/train.py logger=wandb_s3dis ...

# Log KITTI-360 experiments to W&B
python src/train.py logger=wandb_kitti360 ...

# Log DALEs experiments to W&B
python src/train.py logger=wandb_dales ...
```


## ðŸ’³Â Â Credits
- This project was built using [Lightning-Hydra template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).
- The main data structures of this work rely on [PyToch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)
- Some point cloud operations were inspired from the [Torch-Points3D framework](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d), although not merged with the official project at this point. 
- For the KITTI-360 dataset, some code from the official [KITTI-360](https://github.com/autonomousvision/kitti360Scripts) was used.
- Some superpoint-graph-related operations were inspired from [Superpoint Graph](https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph)
- The hierarchical superpoint partition is computed using [Parallel Cut-Pursuit](https://gitlab.com/1a7r0ch3/parallel-cut-pursuit)
